This is to certify that this project is my own work, based on my personal efforts
in studying and applying the concepts
learned. I have constructed the functions and their respective algorithms and
corresponding code by myself. The
program was run, tested, and debugged by my own efforts. I further certify that I
have not copied in part or whole or
otherwise plagiarized the work of other students and/or persons.
