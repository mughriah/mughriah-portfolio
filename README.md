# Mary Faye Caya's Machine Learning Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my GitHub repository showcasing a collection of machine learning projects developed during my first to third years at De La Salle University. 

## Projects Overview

### Project 1: Mastermind's Game 

- **DESCRIPTION:** The Mastermind game involves guessing a sequence of colored pegs based on feedback, while the number guessing game requires guessing a 4-digit number. Both games utilize functions for displaying instructions, handling user input, generating random numbers, and evaluating guesses. The code is structured with modular functions and includes user prompts and game outcomes based on input and random generation.
